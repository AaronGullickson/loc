# loc

Access the [Library of Congress](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) from R.

Chronicling America provides access 140,000 historic newspapers and select digitized newspaper pages.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("news-r/loc")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(loc)

# titles
titles <- loc_search_titles("michigan", pages = 2)

# pages
(articles <- loc_search_pages("Thomas"))
```

The text of the newspaper is in the `ocr_eng` variable. You can reconstruct endpoints to specific newspapers, editions, or issues.

```{r}
a <- sample(articles$url, 1) # take a random article
pdf <- gsub(".json", ".pdf", a) # change to PDF
# browseURL(pdf)
```

And you can get the text with:

```{r}
txt <- gsub(".json", ".txt", a) # change to PDF
readLines(txt)
```
